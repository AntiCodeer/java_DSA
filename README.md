Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.

A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
    Output: [0,1,2,4,5,3]
    Explanation: The array ans is built as follows:
    ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
        = [nums[0], nums[2], nums[1], nums[5], nums[3], nums[4]]
        = [0,1,2,4,5,3]

- [Q28. LeetCode 1929. Concatenation of Array](https://github.com/AntiCodeer/java_DSA/blob/main/src/Q28_leetCodeSol3.java)

Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays.

Return the array ans.

    Example :

    Input: nums = [1,2,1]
    Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]
    Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
    - ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]]
    - ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]

- Q29. [LeetCode 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array](https://github.com/AntiCodeer/java_DSA/blob/main/src/Q29_leetCodeSol4.java)

Return the running sum of nums.

    Example :

    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,3,6,10]
    Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

- Q30. [LeetCode 1672. Richest Customer Wealth](https://github.com/AntiCodeer/java_DSA/blob/main/src/Q30_leetCodeSol5.java)

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

    Example :

    Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
    Output: 10
    Explanation:
    1st customer has wealth = 6
    2nd customer has wealth = 10
    3rd customer has wealth = 8
    The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

- Q31. [LeetCode 1470. Shuffle the Array.](https://github.com/AntiCodeer/java_DSA/blob/main/src/Q31_leetCodeSol6.java)

Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

    Example :

    Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
    Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7]
    Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].
- Q32. [LeetCode 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://github.com/AntiCodeer/java_DSA/blob/main/src/Q32_leetCodeSol7.java)

There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

    Example :

    Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
    Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
    Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
    - Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
    - Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
    - Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
    - Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
    - Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

- Q33. [LeetCode 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number.](https://github.com/AntiCodeer/java_DSA/blob/main/src/Q33_leetCodeSol8.java)

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i]. Return the answer in an array.

        Example :

        Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
        Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
        Explanation:
        For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3).
        For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
        For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
        For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
        For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

        Example :

        Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.

- Q35. [LeetCode 1250. Check If It Is a Good Array.](https://github.com/AntiCodeer/java_DSA/blob/main/src/Q35_leetCodeSol10.java)

Given an array nums of positive integers. Your task is to select some subset of nums, multiply each element by an integer and add all these numbers. The array is said to be good if you can obtain a sum of 1 from the array by any possible subset and multiplicand.

Return True if the array is good otherwise return False.

    Example :

    Input: nums = [12,5,7,23]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Pick numbers 5 and 7.
    5*3 + 7*(-2) = 1

- Q36. [LeetCode 1389. Create Target Array in the Given Order.](https://github.com/AntiCodeer/java_DSA/blob/main/src/Q36_leetCodeSol11.java)

Given two arrays of integers nums and index. Your task is to create target array under the following rules:

Initially target array is empty.
From left to right read nums[i] and index[i], insert at index index[i] the value nums[i] in target array.
Repeat the previous step until there are no elements to read in nums and index.
Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.

     Example :

    Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]
    Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
    Explanation:
    nums       index     target
    0            0        [0]
    1            1        [0,1]
    2            2        [0,1,2]
