- Q1. Findout the Largest No Among Three No's
- Q2. Check Wheather a Chracter is in Uppercase or in Lowercase
- Q3. Check Wheather a Year is in Leap Year or not
- Q4. Solve Fibonacci Series Problem and take no of terms as a input.
- Q5. Check wheather a String or a Number is Palindrome or not.
- Q6. Check wheather a Number is Armstrong Number or not.
- Q7. Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

        Example 1:
        Input: n = 234
        Output: 15
        Explanation:
        Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
        Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
        Result = 24 - 9 = 15

- Q8. Input a number and print all the factors of that number (use loops)
- Q9. Take integer inputs till the user enters 0 and print the sum of all numbers
- Q10. Take integer inputs till the user enters 0 and print the largest number from all.

- Q12. Calculate Average Of N Numbers.
- Q13. Calculate Power of a Numbers.
- Q14. Calculate Ncr & Npr.
- Q15. Reverse A String In Java.
- Q16. HCF and LCM Of Two Numbers Program.
- Q17. Check the No of Vowel And Consonent in A String.
- Q18. Check if a number is Perfect No or Not.
- Q19. Check Wheather a Year is a Leap Year or No.
- Q20. xyz is allowed to go out with his friends only on the even days of a given month. Write a program to count the number of days he can go out in the month of August.
- Q21. Define two methods to print the maximum and the minimum number respectively among three numbers entered by the user.
- Q22. Define a method to find out if a number is prime or not.
- Q23. Define a method to check if a number is Palindrome or not.
- Q24. Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 'Factorial'. Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) *n. E.g.-> 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
- Q25. Write a function that returns all prime numbers between two given numbers.
- Q26. Write a function that returns the sum of first n natural numbers.
- Q27. Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.

A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).

 

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
    Output: [0,1,2,4,5,3]
    Explanation: The array ans is built as follows: 
    ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
        = [nums[0], nums[2], nums[1], nums[5], nums[3], nums[4]]
        = [0,1,2,4,5,3]
